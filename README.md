## Project compilation
To compile the project you need to use [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/)
```bash
ant build
```
## Analysis of Apache software projects
The program allows you to perform analyses on the Jira tickets of an Apache project and to perform measurements on the project classes. It can also analyze the defectiveness of classes in each version of the projects. The results are saved in csv files in `./output/`. The analyses to be performed and the projects to be analysed must be specified in the `config.json` file.

To start the project analysis, type:
```bash
ant SWAnalytics
```
### config.json
The file is an array of jsons, each of which represents a project to analyze.
```json
[{
    "project-name": "BOOKKEEPER", // Name of the project
    "tasks": ["TICKETS", "DATASET", "VERSIONS"], // Types of analysis to perform
    "analysis-types": ["BUGS", "TICKET","NEWFEATURES"], // Types of tickets to analyze (only if you choose the 'TICKETS' task)
    "git-release-regex": "release-%s", // Regex used to identify version names on GitHub. '%s' corresponds to the version number
    "releases-percentage": 50 // Percentage of versions to analyze (only for the 'DATASET' task)
},
...
]
```
## Classifier accuracy analysis
Analyzes the accuracy of the classifier in detecting the defectiveness of a class. Analyses are performed using multiple combinations of feature selection and sampling techniques. The validation technique used is Walk Forward.

The program will use the files generated by the "DATASET" task, inside the project folders in `./output/`, as input files. The files must be converted to `arff` format; to perform the conversion automatically type:
```bash
ant CSV2Arff
```

To start the analysis, type:
```bash
ant WalkForward
```
